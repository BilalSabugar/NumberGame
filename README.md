# 🎯 Guess The Digit – My First Python Game

This is a very small terminal game I wrote as a kid when I was first learning Python.
It helped me understand **loops, conditions, random numbers, and user input** for the first time.

The code is intentionally kept almost exactly as it was back then — messy, imperfect, but real.

## 🕹 How The Game Works

* The program randomly selects a digit between **1 and 9**.
* You get **5 lives**.
* You keep guessing until:

  * You guess the correct number → **You Win**
  * You run out of lives → **You Lose**
* After each wrong guess, it gives you a hint:

  * Guess higher
  * Guess lower

## ▶ How To Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.

2. Save the file as:

```
guess_the_digit.py
```

3. Run it in terminal / command prompt:

```
python guess_the_digit.py
```

## 🧠 What I Learned From This

* Using `while` loops to keep the game running
* Using `if / else` conditions for logic
* Working with the `random` module
* Handling user input and errors
* Thinking in terms of **game state** instead of linear code

---

## 🧱 Limitations

This is **not production-ready code**.

* No error handling if the user enters text instead of numbers
* Typos like “gusseing”
* Hardcoded values
* Not structured into functions

And that’s fine — this project exists to show where I started.

## 🌱 Why This Exists

Everyone shows polished projects.
This shows the **starting point**.

This tiny script is the foundation of everything I built later in Python, AI, robotics, and full-stack apps.
